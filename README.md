# ERP Ranger Mobile Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cos301-2019-se/ERP-Ranger-Mobile-Application.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cos301-2019-se/ERP-Ranger-Mobile-Application)

## Project Description:
Our project is to create a mobile application to assist ERP rangers with various daily tasks. These include, managing a ranger&#39;s patrol shifts, being able to view all said shifts, tracking and reporting a ranger&#39;s position whilst out on patrol, notifying rangers of incident&#39;s that have taken place, allowing rangers to write and submit a report after a shift has finished and managing the park's assets.
